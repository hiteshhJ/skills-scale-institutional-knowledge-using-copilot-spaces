# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation! This repository serves as the central hub for all project management processes, best practices, and guidelines used across OctoAcme teams.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes center around cross-functional collaboration, iterative delivery, and clear accountability. Every project begins with a well-defined initiation phase, ensuring the business need, measurable outcomes, and stakeholder alignment are established via one-pager documents and communication plans. Project Managers (PMs) coordinate delivery, schedules, and risks, while Product Managers (PdMs) set outcomes and prioritization. Developers and QA contribute by breaking down objectives into actionable plans, maintaining test coverage, and validating features, all documented through artifacts like backlogs, risk registers, and acceptance criteria.

Workflows in OctoAcme emphasize agility and transparency. The execution phase relies on daily standups, weekly syncs, and structured project boards to track the lifecycle from backlog to release. Small, frequent pull requests are encouraged, backed by automated testing in CI and peer review requirements. The planning process incorporates sprint kickoffs, estimating (with story points or t-shirt sizing), defining the Definition of Done, and managing dependencies. Risks are proactively logged and escalated through clear paths — from team-level triage to sponsor-level intervention for high-impact issues.

Communication is rigorously structured to keep all participants informed and engaged. Teams maintain weekly and monthly syncs, publish stakeholder updates, and use standardized templates for status and incident communication. Action items and retrospective learnings are tracked in backlogs, reinforcing a cycle of continuous improvement. Escalation paths ensure critical issues are surfaced and resolved with transparency.

Quality assurance is integral to OctoAcme's execution. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are expected for new logic. Security scans, manual QA for major features, and a robust release checklist (including smoke tests and rollback plans) uphold reliability. Release and deployment practices are standardized to minimize risk, employing automated pipelines, staged environments, and thorough post-release verifications. The focus on test coverage, incident playbooks, and retrospective-driven improvements enables OctoAcme to adapt quickly while maintaining consistent delivery quality and stakeholder confidence.
